- When defining a class, To use most classes, you have to create objects. 
  An object is a runtime instance of a class in memory

-Java classes have two primary elements:
  methods -> ften called functions or procedures in other languages
  fields ->m ore generally known as variables

Together these are called the members of the class.

- 8 types of primitives

boolean -> true or false -> default false

byte    -> 8 bit  integral value        -> default = 0
short   -> 18 bit integral value        -> default = 0
int     -> 32 bit integral value        -> default = 0
long    -> 64 bit integral value        -> default = 0

float   -> 32 bit floating-point value  -> default = 0.0
double  -> 64 bit floating-point value  -> default = 0.0

char    -> 16 bit unicode               -> default = '\u0000' (NUL)
