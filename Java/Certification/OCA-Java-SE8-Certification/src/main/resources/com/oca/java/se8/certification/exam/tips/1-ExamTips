Exam Tips - Java Basics

  1.- The classes and interfaces can be defined in any order of occurrence in a 
      Java source code file.
  
  2.- Classes and interfaces defined in the same Java source code file canâ€™t be 
      defined in separate packages. Classes and interfaces imported using 
      the import statement are available to all the classes and interfaces 
      defined in the same Java source code file.
  
  3.- Though both public static and static public are the valid order of 
      keywords to declare the main method, public static is more common and 
      thus more readable.

  4.- The method parameters that are passed to the main method are also called 
      command-line parameters or command-line values. As the name implies, 
      these values are passed to a method from the command line.
