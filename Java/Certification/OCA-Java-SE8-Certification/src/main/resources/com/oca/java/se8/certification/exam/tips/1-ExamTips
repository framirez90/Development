Exam Tips - Java Basics

  1.- The classes and interfaces can be defined in any order of occurrence in a 
      Java source code file.
  
  2.- Classes and interfaces defined in the same Java source code file can’t be 
      defined in separate packages. Classes and interfaces imported using 
      the import statement are available to all the classes and interfaces 
      defined in the same Java source code file.
  
  3.- Though both public static and static public are the valid order of 
      keywords to declare the main method, public static is more common and 
      thus more readable.

  4.- The method parameters that are passed to the main method are also called 
      command-line parameters or command-line values. As the name implies, 
      these values are passed to a method from the command line.

  5.- You don’t need an explicit import statement to use members from the 
      java.lang package. Classes and interfaces in this package are 
      automatically imported in all other Java classes, interfaces, or enums.
  
  6.- Members of a named package can’t access classes and interfaces defined in 
      the default package.

  7.- This feature is called static imports, but the syntax is import static.,p

  8.- A concise but not too simple way of stating the previous rule is this:
      A derived class can inherit and access protected members of its base class,
      regardless of the package in which it’s defined. A derived class in a separate
      package can’t access protected members of its base class using reference
      variables.
